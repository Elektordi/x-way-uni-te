## Presentation

X-Way and UNI-TE (used in Unitelway and similar) are communication protocols for old
Schneider Electrics PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), formerly "Modicon
Télémécanique".
The aim of this open-source project is to create a Java library to sen and
receive such data, because there is actually no open-source project at all in
this field.
Keep in mind that those protocols are old and not maintained anymore by any
company, but still used in many old PLCs installations.

__This project was done at "IG2I", a French IT & Engineering school, department
of "École Centrale de Lille".__

## How to use.
 
The current status of this library does not permit any easy integration.
See it more like a tech demo...

As soon as the test project will be fully working, I will make everything
cleaner and build a real Java JAR-based library for easy use.
And maybe later implementations for others languages.

But feel free to take a look at the current test project in "TestProject" (it's
a Netbeans 7.0.1 console java application project)
